Your Robolectric maintainers are pleased to announce the release of Robolectric 3.3

## Introduction

Robolectric started life in 2010 as a hack to allow Android tests to be run on a regular JVM rather than a device or emulator, allowing for fast [TDD cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Test-driven_development_cycle).

Since then, Robolectric has been widely adopted and has become a critical part of the test infrastructure of ___ lots of projects.

Along with the release of Robolectric 3.3, we’d like to lay out a high-level view of what we see as the steps ahead toward making Robolectric a trusted, well-supported and dependable Android test framework.

In the coming months we’ll be working on:

### Android fidelity // trustworthiness

### Toolchain integration

### Documentation
Robolectric’s documentation has suffered from inattention.

### Performance

### New Android API level support


Expect some APIs to change as we blah blah.



Also, we'd like your feedback and pull requests, oh, and also hey we might know of a job for some awesome person who's super interested in Android testing frameworks!
